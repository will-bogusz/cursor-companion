# Context File Examples

This directory contains example context files demonstrating how to write effective instructions for different types of modules. These examples show best practices for organizing and documenting different parts of your codebase.

## Examples

- `api_users.md`: Example context file for a REST API endpoint
- `service_auth.md`: Example context file for an authentication service
- `models_user.md`: Example context file for a data model

## Usage

These examples are for reference only. When implementing Cursor Companion in your project, create your own context files in `.cursor/instructions/` following these patterns but customized to your specific needs.
