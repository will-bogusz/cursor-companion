# Agent Instructions

This directory contains instruction files that are passed to the AI coding assistant in different scenarios. These files are not meant to be used directly by users but rather serve as the basis for how the AI agent behaves in different contexts.

## Files

- `global_rules.md`: Base rules passed to any agent interaction via .cursorrules
- `composer.md`: Instructions for the agent when making multi-file changes

Note: These instructions are distinct from the examples provided in the examples/ directory, which show users how to write their own context files.
